**HTML, CSS, Javascript**

I have created a popular Buzzfeed-style quiz in South Korea, which consists of 6 questions with two options each. **In this project, we made a deliberate effort to prioritize the implementation of dynamic design through JavaScript, rather than focusing extensively on the overall website aesthetics.**
To ensure accuracy, I referred to the text and images of existing results while iterating on the questions. Based on the combination of the answers to each question, the quiz generates different and interesting results. Give it a try!

## What Worked Well
I have successfully organized the quiz questions using separate JavaScript files, utilizing flexbox for optimal layout. Additionally, I utilized vanilla JavaScript for the implementation of the website, resulting in a well-organized and structured codebase. The design also includes visually appealing animation effects that add to the overall user experience.

## What Didn't
Aligning the text and images of the quiz question options was a challenging task. I implemented a special lamination effect that adjusts the size of the option when hovered over, which added an extra layer of complexity to the design.

## Extra Credit
* why might it be better for this to be placed at the bottom : This is because when the browser encounters a script tag in the head, it stops rendering the page until the script has finished loading and executing. In other words,if the JavaScript code is large or takes a long time to execute, the user will experience a delay in seeing the content of the page.
* Designed with multipages (not all quizes in the same page)
* Extra Credit : button Styling & extra animations
